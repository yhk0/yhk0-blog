I'm a pentester and software engineer, currently working as a Junior Developer. With over 3 years of experience using Golang and Python, they specialize in creating efficient and secure solutions for various technical challenges.

I have a strong interest in Linux and Windows exploration, diving deep into both operating systems to discover vulnerabilities and optimize performance. I actively participate in bug bounty programs.

I use the TryHackMe and HackTheBox platforms to continuously improve my knowledge in cybersecurity and programming. My expertise lies in combining practical penetration testing skills with software development to create tools that contribute to the security community.
